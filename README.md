# Human-annotated-Tweet-Classification-Using-XLM-RoBERTa

Data Preparation and Processing: Accomplished the transformation of categorical labels into numerical form, as measured by the successful encoding of 'manifestolabel_human' column in the DataFrame, by utilizing sklearn's LabelEncoder.

Model Training: Accomplished the training of a pre-trained XLM-RoBERTa model on the dataset, as measured by the completion of 10 training epochs, by implementing TensorFlow's model compilation and fitting methods.
